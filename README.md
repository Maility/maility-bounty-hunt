# Maility Full-Stack Developer Coding Test

Welcome, developer! You've embarked on the Maility coding challenge to prove your full-stack development skills. Below you'll find all the information needed to complete the test, including the project requirements, structure, and submission guidelines.

## Test Overview

This test covers the following aspects:

1. **Frontend**: Modern JavaScript (ES6) with Material UI
2. **Backend**: Firebase/Firestore and Firebase functions
3. **Hosting**: You can host this however way you like!

## Project Structure

The project is divided into frontend and backend components:

### Frontend

The frontend is built using modern JavaScript (ES6) and Material UI. You will find a toolbar and two big placeholders where you'll code a CSV upload component and a simple textarea from which to compose an email.

### Backend

The backend is built using Firebase/Firestore and Firebase functions. You will find a partially implemented Firebase data model and functions, including a nodemailer function that takes a mail body, subject, and email address, and sends the email. You'll also need to implement a simple cron job task.

## Test Requirements

To complete this coding test, you'll need to accomplish the following tasks:

1. Implement a CSV upload component in the frontend.
2. Implement a simple textarea component in the frontend.
3. Be able to send these to the Firestore backend
4. Create functions to send the emails
5. Complete the nodemailer function in the backend that sends emails.
6. Implement a simple cron job task

## Submission Guidelines

Once you've completed the test, please follow these steps for submission:

1. Fork this GitHub repository.
2. Complete the coding test according to the requirements mentioned above.
3. Host the project on Repl.it (bonus points for this step).
4. Submit a pull request to the original repository with your changes.
5. In the pull request description, include a link to your hosted project on Repl.it.

Good luck, and may the coding winds be in your favor!
